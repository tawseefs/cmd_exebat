## What is this?

This is near useless. It is a way to get into Command Prompt when you can't. It saves two minutes of time.

## @ECHO OFF

This is a clean way to save a few second and run CMD. This contains an .exe and a .bat, launch whichever you prefer. Just enter command.

## @ECHO ON

Same as previous, apart from you see more.

## MIXED ECHO

A mix.

## I hate you.
Same.

## License

Do whatever, I don't give a crap. This is some old crap from years ago, and really niche, but maybe it might help someone. Have a good day. If you can make money off this, go ahead. Good luck.
